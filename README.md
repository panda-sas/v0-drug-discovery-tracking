## How It Works

1. Create and modify your project using [v0.app](https://v0.app)
2. Deploy your chats from the v0 interface
3. Changes are automatically pushed to this repository
4. Vercel deploys the latest version from this repository

## Key Features

1. Library Management – Create and organize libraries of compound plates from multiple suppliers.
2. Plate Hierarchy Tracking – Build flexible parent-child relationships (Vendor → Master → Screening → Hit Collection).
3. Plate Import & Assignment – Bulk import plates via CSV and assign them to sets and libraries.
4. Check-In / Check-Out System – Track which scientist has which plate, with full date and activity logs.
5. Scientist Profiles – Manage lab member details and experimental records.
6. Notes & Metadata – Add detailed annotations and descriptions across all entities.
7. Hierarchy Dashboard – Visualize the lineage of plates across all sets.
8. Admin View – Full CRUD access for managing libraries, plates, sets, and scientists.

## Why Platrix

Platrix simplifies complex lab logistics by turning plate management into an intelligent, traceable workflow.
No more spreadsheets or lost sample records — every plate has a story, and Platrix helps you tell it.
